Android elements (especially lower than API 21) does not support shadows, except if using [CardView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/cardview) While CardView gets the `elevation` attribute, there is no easy way to customize this shadow in any other way.

We try to address this here and produce custom, controllable shadow.

Playing around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Markdown. Looks pretty easy.
What about the code formatting?:
```java
int a = 1;
if (a == 1){
  int b = 3;
}
```
