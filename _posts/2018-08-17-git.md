There are git commands that you need and kind of use often, but not every day, so you need to Google them sometimes.

### Interactive Rebase
If you want to squash, edit, delete, modify your history. For example do something with *5* last commits:
```
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

### Checkout files from specific commit
To get a few files from specific commit:
```bash
git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
```
To get the files a commit before specific commit:
```bash
git checkout c5f567~1 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
```
